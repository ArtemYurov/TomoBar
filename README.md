## Overview
Have you ever heard of Pomodoro? Itâ€™s a great technique to help you keep track of time and stay on task during your studies or work. Read more about it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Wikipedia</a>.

TomoBar is world's neatest Pomodoro timer for the macOS menu bar. All the essential features are here - configurable
work and rest intervals, optional sounds, discreet actionable notifications, global hotkey.

TomoBar is fully sandboxed with no entitlements (except for the Apple Events entitlement, used to run the Do Not Disturb toggle shortcut).
